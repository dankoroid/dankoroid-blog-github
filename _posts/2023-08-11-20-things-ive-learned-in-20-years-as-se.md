Some time ago I've read this great article by [Justin Etheredge](https://www.simplethread.com/author/jetheredge/) - [20 Things I’ve Learned in my 20 Years as a Software Engineer](https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/) - and here is what from these points I find extremely useful:

1. The best code is no code, or code you don’t have to maintain
2. Always strive to build a smaller system
3. Keep your processes as lean as possible
4. We should be far more focused on avoiding 0.1x programmers than finding 10x programmers
5. People don’t really want innovation
<br>If you truly innovate, and change the way that people have to do things, expect mostly negative feedback. If you believe in what you’re doing, and know it will really improve things, then brace yourself for a long battle.
6. Your data is the most important part of your system
<br>Dealing with partial or dirty data in the future can become a nightmare. Just remember, your data will likely long outlive your codebase. Spend energy keeping it orderly and clean, it’ll pay off well in the long run.
7. Look for technological sharks
<br>Old technologies that have stuck around are sharks, not dinosaurs. They solve problems so well that they have survived the rapid changes that occur constantly in the technology world. Don’t bet against these technologies, and replace them only if you have a very good reason.
8. Don’t mistake humility for ignorance
<br>There are a lot of software engineers out there who won’t express opinions unless asked. Never assume that just because someone isn’t throwing their opinions in your face that they don’t have anything to add. Sometimes the noisiest people are the ones we want to listen to the least.
