Here are some quotes from [Philipp Hauer's article](https://phauer.com/2022/book-remote-work-lessons-learned/) about book “Effective Remote Work” by [James Stanier](https://twitter.com/jstanier) that could be used by improving remote work:

1. Treat everyone as remote
  <br>That affects everything: tools, meeting setup, information exchange, communication, documentation, and opportunities.
2. Rely on asynchronous communication and produce artifacts
3. You should break the asynchronous-communication-rule occasionally; make room for socializing
4. Daily journaling
  <br>Close each day with a short reflection and write down your findings
5. Put boundaries between your work time and your personal time
6. As a manager, you should over-communicate
  <br>Repetition makes your message stick, and your message will be missed by someone at some time anyway
