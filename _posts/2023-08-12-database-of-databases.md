There is a good side that could help to determine what database to use based on input - [Database of Databases](https://dbdb.io/).

It has some high-level info about DB, for example:
- Compression
- Concurrency Control
- Data Model
- Foreign Keys
- Indexes
- Isolation Levels
- Logging
- Storage Architecture
- Storage Model
- System Architecture
- Views
  etc
