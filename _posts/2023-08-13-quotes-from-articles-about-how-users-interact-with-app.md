[4 things i learned after getting users](https://basementcommunity.bearblog.dev/things-i-learned/):
1. Someone is going to abuse your site:
  - racist usernames
  - posts full of slurs
  - abusing API
2. You need a performance monitoring system
  If you app won't handle the load - you need to know what exact part is the bottleneck to make proper adjustments
3. Your SQL queries need to be optimized
4. Your users might have genius ideas

[Users are almost always right](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/UsersAreRight):

One of the rules of system design ought to be this:
> When the users keep doing it wrong, the users are right and your system is wrong.

If the users keep making some error, changing their behavior is going to be very difficult and therefor costly. (In a fight between user inertia and anything else, bet on user inertia.)

From this main for me is that users always come first - as without users any system is useless. And if users a doing something against expected flow - discover why and that could help to improve overall experience

Last quote, personally for me, is one of variants of [Desire path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path) - when people tread some path in the grass instead of having a bit longer route on walkways that already exist
