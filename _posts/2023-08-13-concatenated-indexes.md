Some useful things about concatenated indexes from [Use the index, Luke - Concatenated Indexes](https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/where-clause/the-equals-operator/concatenated-keys):

Column order of a concatenated index has great impact on its usability so it must be chosen carefully.

Whenever a query uses the complete primary key, the database can use an INDEX UNIQUE SCANâ€”no matter how many columns the index has.

The database cannot use index for searching single columns from a concatenated index arbitrarily

A concatenated index is just a B-tree index like any other that keeps the indexed data in a sorted list. The database considers each column according to its position in the index definition to sort the index entries. The first column is the primary sort criterion and the second column determines the order only if two entries have the same value in the first column and so on.

The ordering of a two-column index is therefore like the ordering of a telephone directory: it is first sorted by surname, then by first name. That means that a two-column index does not support searching on the second column alone; that would be like searching a telephone directory by first name.

In general, a database can use a concatenated index when searching with the leading (leftmost) columns. An index with three columns can be used when searching for the first column, when searching with the first two columns together, and when searching using all columns.

Even though the two-index solution delivers very good select performance as well, the single-index solution is preferable. It not only saves storage space, but also the maintenance overhead for the second index. The fewer indexes a table has, the better the insert, delete and update performance.
