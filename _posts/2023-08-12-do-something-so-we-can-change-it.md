These would be quotes from article ["Do Something, So We Can Change It!"](https://allenpike.com/2023/do-something-so-we-can-change-it) written by [Allen Pike](https://allenpike.com/).

> When you get stuck on a decision - do something and then change if needed.

> At Amazon, they talk about this same idea by encouraging teams to recognize “two-way doors.” In this model, a one-way door is a decision that is mostly irreversible.
> 
> Most decisions, though, are two-way doors.

> The point is this: sometimes, we need to make an irreversible decision. Most often, though, we simply need to do something for now, so we can keep moving. So we can learn.
> 
> So we can change it.

And [comment from HackerNews by echohack5](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37004410) about being careful with these decisions:
> some decisions work by "path dependency". If something works, even if it is a poor implementation, the path to get there is holy ground and the amount of effort to change a 10 minute decision that was made flippintly by two business people chatting in the urinals on a Wednesday is like trying to siege the walls of Jehrico.
