title: "Remove 'just' from your documentation"

This post is short compilation of my take-aways from [If someone’s having to read your docs, it’s not “simple”](https://justsimply.dev/) page:

> Scan your technical writing for words such as easy, painless, straightforward, trivial, simple and just.
> 
> Chances are your writing will be clearer as a result of removing them

> It would be cleaner, less cluttered and less, frankly, infuriating. No programming is “painfully simple”, so let’s make sure our docs don’t put people off using the code we’ve worked so hard to create.
