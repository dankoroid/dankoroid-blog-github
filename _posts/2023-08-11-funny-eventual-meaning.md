Was watching YT video named [My thoughts on the CAP theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmGy3sU6Xw) on [Hussein Nasser YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@hnasr) - and there was a [funny take on 'eventual concept'](https://youtu.be/KmGy3sU6Xw8?t=163):

What here is funny to me is that these things are technically true.

But for me this is not about arguing about eventual consistency when it is properly used. 
<br>It makes me think about actual performance/design of application - is eventual consistency a trade-off based on some inputs - or is just a term used to hide inefficiencies of system/desing of the system?
