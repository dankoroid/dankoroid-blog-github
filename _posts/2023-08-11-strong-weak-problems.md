title: "Strong/Weak link problems"

These are my take-aways from article [Science is a strong-link problem](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/science-is-a-strong-link-problem) posted by [Adam Mastroianni](https://substack.com/@experimentalhistory):

There are 2 different types of problems: 
- Strong-link
<br>These are problems where overall quality depends on how good the best stuff is, and the bad stuff barely matters.
- Weak-link
<br>These are problems where the overall quality depends on how good the worst stuff is. You fix weak-link problems by making the weakest links stronger, or by eliminating them entirely.

Main point I got from this article - if that your problem is strong-link type - you should not care about failures & risk, as 1 win would most likely bring the best possible outcome
