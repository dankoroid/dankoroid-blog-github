Summary of [this video about time management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHRCTwvvGTU)- Task management is more effective than overvalued time management:

- Task management involves prioritizing tasks for maximum impact
- "Urgency trapping" is when people only focus on urgent tasks without considering future consequences
- Deep work should be result of good environment, not just a scheduled task. You can do this by going about your day and noting down what distracts you throughout the day, and finding a way to eliminate those distractions
- Identifying distractions, changing environment, and setting boundaries for deep work are more important than "doing deep work" for its own sake

Classification of officers by Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord

I distinguish four types. There are clever, hardworking, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and hardworking; their place is the General Staff. The next ones are stupid and lazy; they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the mental clarity and strength of nerve necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is both stupid and hardworking; he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always only cause damage.
