Summary of [this video about time management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHRCTwvvGTU)- Task management is more effective than overvalued time management:

- Task management involves prioritizing tasks for maximum impact
- "Urgency trapping" is when people only focus on urgent tasks without considering future consequences
- Deep work should be result of good environment, not just a scheduled task. You can do this by going about your day and noting down what distracts you throughout the day, and finding a way to eliminate those distractions
- Identifying distractions, changing environment, and setting boundaries for deep work are more important than "doing deep work" for its own sake
