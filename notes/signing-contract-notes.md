From this article about contracts that you should never sign (https://vadimkravcenko.com/shorts/contracts-you-should-never-sign/) I find those points compelling:

1. Don't sign any form of a non-compete clause in employee contracts
These clauses prohibit an individual from working for a competitor for a certain period after leaving a company.
There are other more effective ways to protect a company's IP or against solicitation from former employees.
If you're an engineer and get offered a non-compete, turn it down. Plain and simple. Even with all the layoffs happening, there is still a shortage of skilled developers, so you're in demand, and you can always find a company that cares about keeping a good relationship with their employees instead of ruining their future potential (even if it is outside of their company).

2. Be careful with Confidentiality agreements (Non-Disclosure Agreements; NDA)
Be wary of contracts that are overly strict about types of information that are allowed to be shared and that is not genuinely confidential. Most of them also don't have ANY expiration date, which is a big no-no.
If you really need to sign one — it needs to define precisely what is protected by the NDA. Contain no broad language, and contain an expiration date, the agreed penalties, and the jurisdiction.

3. Don't sign any contract with exclusive distribution agreements (unless you know what you're doing)
Contracts that require one business to use the services of the other exclusively can limit future growth opportunities and should be avoided if possible.

4. Don't sign a contract for a project-based agreement without a clear definition of scope and definition of done
This can go wrong in so many ways, as you and the Client have very different opinion.
Any work contract should be explicit, never implicit.

5. Work-for-hire clauses a.k.a "Everything belongs to your employer"
These clauses transfer ownership of any work created during the contract to the hiring party. Sounds straightforward and logical, except it means:
- Anything you do with the company property, e.g., work computer, automatically belongs to the company, even if you do it on the weekends.
- If you work for a software hub, any SaaS app you build over the weekend will belong to the company, regardless of whether you do it with company property or not — as it's related to the company's business.
- Belonging to the company means everything, not just the IP — the revenue, the code, and the good vibes.

Ideally, before starting any side hustle — clear it up with your employer. Even if you think you're in the clear, it's highly recommended to have everything in writing where you're specifically granted an exemption from this clause. Most of the time, this clause is just a catch-all protection against the employee trying to claim copyright on something they built for the company, so it's very easy to get an exemption to this clause if you explain your case.

6. One-sided termination clauses
Every clause should have a balance of what it takes from you and what it gives you.

7. Unclear compensation rules
Related to shares:
- Absence of vesting period. 
Vesting is the period you must wait before turning your options into shares.
- No explicit termination clause
If your CEO can fire you on a whim — consider yourself expendable. Before you sign any sweat equity agreement, check that there are clear performance criteria described in the exit clause.
- No mention of Tag-Along and Drag-Along Rights in your shareholder agreement
Tag-along protects you as a minority shareholder, someone sells — you can sell at the same price also. The drag-along right protects the majority shareholder. If they sell, they can also force you to sell under the same conditions. You might be at a disadvantage if the contracts don’t have them.

8. Automatic renewal clauses
Some contracts automatically renew for a fixed period unless the individual or company takes action to terminate the agreement. These can be difficult to get out of, so read the fine print. Kudos to those who notify you a few weeks before the deadline.

From Hacker News comments about "Contracts you should never sign"  (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34544008)I've extracted such points:

1. Treat contract negotiation as a trial run for your future relationship
2. The way they [employers] treat you when you're interviewing is the best they will ever treat you.
3. Lawyers are really good at knowing when they actually have power and when they do not. Unfortunately, when they don't truly have legal power they resort to bullying. So if you are being bullied to sign a contract, that usually is a red flag to stop, really look at things, and figure out why they are using that tactic. You may be in a better situation than you think.
4. Verify that anything you're signing when you leave matches what you signed when you were hired.
5. Watch out for any clawbacks (returning money that were already paid to you)
