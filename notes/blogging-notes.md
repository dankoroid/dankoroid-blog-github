Stumbled upon article named Some blogging myths (https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/06/05/some-blogging-myths/) and there are a great points about blogging:

1. Myth: you need to be original
The idea is that if I found it confusing, lots of other people probably did too, even though the information might theoretically be out there on the internet somewhere. Just because there is information on the internet, it doesn’t get magically teleported into people’s brains!

2. Myth: you need to be an expert
You actually just need to know 1-2 interesting things that the reader doesn’t. And if you just learned the thing yesterday, it’s certain that lots of other people don’t know it either.

3. Myth: posts need to be 100% correct
I’m happy to leave it as an “I think” and potentially correct later it if someone tells me it’s wrong.

4. Myth: writing boring posts is bad
The reality of publishing things on the internet is that interesting things get boosted, and boring things get ignored. So people are basically guaranteed to think your posts are much more interesting that they actually are, because they’re more likely to see your interesting posts.
I really Darius Kazemi’s How I Won The Lottery talk on this topic about how putting things on the internet is like buying lots of lottery tickets, and the best way to “win” is to make a lot of stuff.

5. Myth: you need to explain every concept
Easiest way to start was to pick one person and write for them.

6. Myth: more material is always better
It is personal opinion, but short articles are easier to read for a broader audience

7. Myth: everyone should blog
Blogging isn’t for everyone. I write because it’s fun for me and it helps me organize my thoughts.
